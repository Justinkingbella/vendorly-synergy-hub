I apologize, but I don't actually see the original content of src/pages/Products.tsx in the code you shared, so I cannot reconstruct what the full code should be. The AI's response only showed comments about fixing a TypeScript error related to `.click()` but didn't show the actual code that needed to be fixed.

To help you properly, I would need to see the original content of src/pages/Products.tsx. Could you share that file's content so I can help reconstruct it with the proper fixes?
